# Three-tier Cloud Infrastructure Architecture
This Terraform configuration sets up a three-tier cloud infrastructure on AWS, incorporating Elastic Container Service (ECS) for containerized applications. The architecture is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant, utilizing various AWS services for different layers.

## Components:
1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
A VPC is created to isolate resources and provide network security.
It's divided into public and private subnets across multiple availability zones for redundancy.

2. Public Subnets:
Public subnets host resources that need to be accessible from the internet, such as load balancers.
Instances launched in public subnets can have public IP addresses and route their traffic directly through the Internet Gateway.

3. Private Subnets:
Private subnets host resources that should not be directly accessible from the internet, such as application servers and databases.
Instances launched in private subnets can have private IP addresses and route their traffic through a NAT Gateway to access the internet.

4. Internet Gateway (IGW):
An Internet Gateway is attached to the VPC to allow communication between instances in public subnets and the internet.

5. NAT Gateway:
A NAT Gateway is used to allow instances in private subnets to initiate outbound internet traffic while blocking inbound traffic from the internet.

6. Elastic Container Service (ECS):
ECS is used to run and manage containerized applications.
ECS clusters are deployed within the private subnets for increased security.
ECS services and tasks are deployed across ECS clusters, providing scalability and high availability for containerized workloads.

7. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):
The ELB helps distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of our application. It ensures our system remains available by evenly spreading the load.

## Usage:
- Define the necessary variables in the variables.tf file, including the VPC CIDR block, public and private subnet CIDR blocks, ECS cluster configuration, and region.
- Configure the main Terraform files (main.tf) for VPC, subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, and ECS clusters according to your requirements.
- Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform configuration.
- Run terraform plan to see the execution plan and verify the changes.
- Run terraform apply to apply the changes and create the infrastructure on AWS.
- After completion, you can use the outputs to obtain the VPC ID, public and private subnet IDs, ECS cluster information, and other relevant details.
# Considerations:
- Ensure that the CIDR blocks for VPC and subnets do not overlap and are properly configured for your network requirements.
- Review the security group settings, network access control lists (NACLs), and ECS task definitions to control inbound and outbound traffic and ensure proper configuration for containerized applications.
- This architecture provides a scalable and resilient foundation for deploying containerized applications in a cloud environment on AWS.
